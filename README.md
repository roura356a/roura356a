## ¡Hola! :wave:
I’m [Alberto Roura](https://albertoroura.com/), a cloud computing _nerd_ from Spain specialised in all things “_APAC Cloud_”


### :cloud: Alibaba Cloud
Alibaba Cloud awarded me as MVP in 2018, 2019 & 2020, becoming eventually the **#1** MVP globally. Do you need help? I provide [Implementation/Consulting services](https://albertoroura.com/alibaba-cloud-consulting/).

If you want to learn how to start deploying in China, APAC region or need a hand on using Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, AWS or Huawei Cloud, I can help with general consulting, cloud migrations, solutions architecting, DevOps services, health checks and custom reporting.
