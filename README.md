## ¡Hola! :wave:
I’m [Alberto Roura](https://albertoroura.com/), a cloud computing _nerd_ from Spain specialised in all things “_China IT_”


### :cloud: Alibaba Cloud
Alibaba Cloud awarded me as MVP in 2018, 2019 & 2020, becoming eventually the **#1** MVP globally. Do you need help? I provide Training/Consulting services through [Roopu Cloud](https://roopu.cloud/), a company I co-founded. If you want to learn how to start deploying in China or need a hand on using Alibaba Cloud, I can help with general consulting, cloud migrations, solutions architecting, health checks and custom reporting.
