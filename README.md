## ¡Hola! :wave:
I’m [Alberto Roura](https://albertoroura.com/), a cloud computing _nerd_ from Spain specialised in **accelerating foreign websites in China**.

### :zap: China Acceleration
Your business' site, _very likely_, doesn't work in China. That's just the reality for **+90%** of foreign sites. When it comes to internet and how this space is regulated, China is not just another country. China is _another universe_.

**Guess what, [I fixed that for you](https://guztia.com/accelerate-site-china)**.


### :cloud: Alibaba Cloud
Alibaba Cloud awarded me as **MVP** in 2018, 2019, 2020 & 2021, becoming repeteadly the **#1** MVP globally. Do you need help? I provide [Implementation/Consulting services](https://guztia.com/services).

If you want to learn how to start deploying in China, APAC region or need a hand on using Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, AWS or Tencent Cloud, I can help with general consulting, cloud migrations, solutions architecting, DevOps services, health checks and custom reporting.
